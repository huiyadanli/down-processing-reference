    This keyword is used to disallow other classes access to the fields and methods within a class. The
    <b>
     private
    </b>
    keyword is used before a field or method that you want to be available only within the class. In Processing, all fields and methods are public unless otherwise specified by the
    <b>
     private
    </b>
    keyword.

    This keyword is an essential part of Java programming and is not usually used with Processing. Consult a Java language reference or tutorial for more information.
